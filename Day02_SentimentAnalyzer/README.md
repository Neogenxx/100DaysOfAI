# Day 2 â€“ Sentiment Analyzer ðŸ§ ðŸ’¬

This is a simple Python-based Sentiment Analyzer built using the `TextBlob` library. It takes input text from the user and classifies the sentiment as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** based on the polarity score.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **TextBlob** â€“ Used to perform sentiment analysis by calculating polarity and subjectivity from the input text.
